<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi! My name is Mark Russell. I'm a visual Arts Major at Miami Intl. University of Art and Design. I love to paint, draw and pretty much do evrything else related to visualarts. I was Born and raised in sunny South Florida, Miami to be exact. I am married to my lovely wife Latricia, we have a 2 year old son and a daughter on the way. When I'm not busy doing art, working, spending time with my family or in class i try to squeeze in a little reading.</p>
